## Contributions

List down the contribution of each group members.

For example:

### Raja Fitri Haziq Bin Raja Mohd Fuad (1211101242)

1. Implemented the feature where the user can either use the default values or update a new value before printing out the game board. (The values have been restricted to certain conditions to meet the game requirement)
2. Implemented the feature where the program can clear the screen and prints out the next  output at the same screen by using the "cstdlib" functions.

### Muhammad Irfan Bin Zulkifli (1211103094)

1. Implemented the feature where the program is able to create a 1-dimensional array using class functions based on the default values or the updated values while randomly generating game attributes such as game objects, zombies and alien.
2. Implemented the feature where the program can clear the screen and prints out the next  output at the same screen by using the "cstdlib" functions.

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

1. We originally used a lot of void functions to create the game board but ended up discarding the idea as it gave the code bad readability and hard for us to encounter and fix errors. Hence, we decided to redo the whole code and clean it up using class functions.
